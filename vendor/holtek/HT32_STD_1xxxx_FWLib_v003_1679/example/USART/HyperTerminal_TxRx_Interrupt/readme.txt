 @endverbatim

@par Example Description:

This example describes how to configure USART & UART simultaneously transmit by interrupt.

The USART_CLK frequency is equal to CK_SYS.

Both USARTs are configured with 8-bit Word length, one stop bit, no parity and baud rate is set to 115200 bps,
remember to enable THREIE & RLSIE interrupt for both USARTs.

The COM1 will make sure that URRxWriteIndex >= 5, then URxTxBuf will be transferred by IRQHandler.
If URRxWriteIndex >= 5, USARTx_IRQHandler will eable USART_INT_TXDE interrupt, until URTxWriteIndex = 5 then disable interrupt.
Otherwise if the interrupt is generated by USART_FLAG_RXDR set, COM1 will receive datum to URxRxBuf[].

- USART/HyperTerminal_TxRx_Interrupt/main.c               Main program
- USART/HyperTerminal_TxRx_Interrupt/ht32fxxxx_it.c       Interrupt handlers

@par Hardware and Software Environment:

  - Refer "ht32_board_config.h" for pin assignment.
  - Connect a null-modem female/female RS232 cable between the COM1 connector
    and PC serial port. HyperTerminal configuration:
  - Word Length = 8 Bits
  - One Stop Bit
  - No parity
  - BaudRate = 115200 baud
  - flow control: None
- This example can be run on HT32 Series development board.
